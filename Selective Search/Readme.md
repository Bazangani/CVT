# Selective Search Repository

Welcome to the Selective Search repository! This repository contains an implementation of the Selective Search algorithm for object proposal generation in computer vision applications.

## Overview

Selective Search is an object proposal algorithm that identifies potential regions of interest (ROIs) within an image. These ROIs are likely to contain objects and can be used to improve the efficiency of object detection algorithms.

This repository provides an implementation of the Selective Search algorithm in [programming language or framework], along with [any additional features, enhancements, or modifications you've made].

## Features

- [List any key features or capabilities of your implementation]
- [You can use bullet points to highlight important features]
