# Selective Search Repository

Welcome to the Selective Search repository! This repository contains an implementation of the Selective Search algorithm for object proposal generation in computer vision applications.

## Overview

Selective Search is an object proposal algorithm that identifies potential regions of interest (ROIs) within an image. These ROIs are likely to contain objects and can be used to improve the efficiency of object detection algorithms.

This repository provides an implementation of the Selective Search algorithm in Python, based on the original paper: Uijlings, Jasper RR, et al. "Selective search for object recognition." International journal of computer vision 104 (2013): 154-171.
The flowchart of the algorithm is as follows:

   +--------------+
   |   Over-      |
   | segmentation |
   +--------------+
         |
         v
   +--------------+
   |    Group     |
   |    Similar   |
   |   Regions    |
   +--------------+
         |
         v
   +--------------+
   |   Create     |
   |  Initial     |
   |  Object      |
   | Proposals    |
   +--------------+
         |
         v
   +--------------+
   |   Iteratively|
   |   Merge      |
   |   Regions    |
   |   Based on   |
   |   Similarity |
   +--------------+
         |
         v
   +--------------+
   |  Generate    |
   |  Final Set   |
   | of Proposals |
