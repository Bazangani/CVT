# Selective Search Repository

Welcome to the Selective Search repository! This repository contains an implementation of the Selective Search algorithm for object proposal generation in computer vision applications.

## Overview

Selective Search is an object proposal algorithm that identifies potential regions of interest (ROIs) within an image. These ROIs are likely to contain objects and can be used to improve the efficiency of object detection algorithms.

This repository provides an implementation of the Selective Search algorithm in Python, based on the original paper: Uijlings, Jasper RR, et al. "Selective search for object recognition." International journal of computer vision 104 (2013): 154-171.
The flowchart of the algorithm is as follows:

1. Over-segmentation:
   - The input image is divided into smaller segments based on colour, texture, or other features. This produces an initial set of regions that could potentially contain objects.

2. Group Similar Regions:
   - Similar neighbouring segments are grouped together, creating more prominent regions. This step aims to capture more meaningful regions that are likely to represent objects.

3. Create Initial Object Proposals:
   - The initial regions formed after grouping are treated as the first set of object proposals. These proposals may contain both false positives and true positives.

4. Iteratively Merge Regions:
   - In an iterative process, the algorithm merges regions based on their similarity scores. Similar regions are grouped together, and the process continues iteratively, creating a hierarchy of region clusters.

5. Generate Final Set of Proposals:
   - The hierarchy of region clusters is used to generate a final set of object proposals. These proposals have varying sizes and capture objects at different scales and positions in the image.
